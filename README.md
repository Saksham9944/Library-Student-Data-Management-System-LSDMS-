Library Student Data Management System Project: An Overview

Library Student Data Management System is a GUI that is designed to manage student data in a library. The primary goal of a Library Student Data Management System project is to develop a system that can simplify and automate the management of student data in a library. The system should allow library administrators to manage student data efficiently, and it should also provide a user-friendly interface for user to access their data.

Key Features:

Registration of student data: The system allows user to register the student's personal information such as name, roll number, their branch, and email id. The registration process is simple, and the system stores the data in a file for future reference.

Issuing books : The system allows user to issue books to students. The system keeps track of the number of books issued to each student and this feature should also allow user to keep track of the book that was issued to a particular student.And the student can not issue more than 4 books.

Returning books: The system allows students to return the books by the user which they have borrowed from the library. The user can return the book. The system updates the student's record and then students can issue more books.

Checking of student data: The system provides a search feature that allows user to search for students' information such as their name, email ID, branch. The LSDMS should allow allow to check student data related to the books that they have issued. This feature should enable user to check which books a student has issued.
